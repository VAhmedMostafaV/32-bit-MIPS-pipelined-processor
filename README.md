# 32-bit-MIPS-pipelined-processor
Welcome to our 32-bit MIPS pipelined processor project! In this repository, we have implemented a MIPS processor capable of executing R-type, I-type, and J-type instructions. Below is a list of instructions that have been successfully implemented:

## R-type Instructions:
add
subtract
or
and
slt (Set Less Than)

## I-type Instructions:
addi
lw (Load Word)
sw (Store Word)
BEQ (Branch Equal)

## J-type Instructions:
Unconditional jump

Our implementation utilizes pipelining to improve the efficiency of instruction execution, allowing for concurrent processing of multiple instructions

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance and expand the capabilities of our MIPS pipelined processor. Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.

## Feedback
If you have any feedback, suggestions, or encounter any issues with our MIPS pipelined processor, please open an issue on GitHub or contact me directly.
